# The-effect-of-covid-on-economic-inactivity
Economic Inactivity has become an important issue to the UK government in recent years as this is a method of measuring how much of its population is actively working or seeking work.
There are several reasons why members of the population might be out of active work (employment or self-employment) at a point in time; sickness, childbirth, age and retirement, etc.
There are also several factors that could affect the rate at which people are actively engaged in work or not; Covid-19 and Brexit for example.
For this project, we have selected Covid-19 and have decided to see how the number of cases/deaths have impacted job vacancy and availability within Tees Valley, North Yorkshire, Uk.
We have also limited our research to be within the working ages of 16 - 64
Tees Valley is made up of five locations in the North Yorkshire; Hartlepool, Darlington, Middlesbrough, Redcar & Cleveland, and Stockton-on-Tees.
We have also compared the level of economic inactivity in Tees Valley to the rest of the UK.
